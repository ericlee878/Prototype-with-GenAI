My Experience

Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
- The code runs and mostly works. Some functionalities are not exactly as I envisioned them, and it was difficult to get GPT to get the functionality to exactly how I wanted it.

How is the code better than what the team currently has?
- No.

How is the code worse?
- The code has not good UI, and some weird functionalities that are not practical.

How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
- It took multiple prompts. Maybe around 20? The main struggle was to try to get GPT to understand my thoughts.

Overall impression of the experience
- GPT is very powerful and could be very useful if used in the right way.
